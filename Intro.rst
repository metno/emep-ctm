Welcome to EMEP
================

This guide gives a brief documentation of the EMEP/MSC-W model version
rv4.33. It is intended primarily as a guide on how to run the model, and
to help users wishing to understand or change the model in terms of
domains, outputs, chemistry, etc.

The main documentation for the EMEP/MSC-W model is an article published
in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics in 2012. This article will be
referred to as Simpson et al. (2012) in this manual.

The model source code is available from the Open Source EMEP/MSC-W model
github page:

Licenses and Caveats
--------------------

The EMEP code is provided under the GNU General Public License version 3
(http://fsf.org and/or http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

Each code module is prefaced with something like:

.. literalinclude:: header.f90

And a copy of the license file, **gpl.txt**, is provided with the model
code source files.

It is important to note that the code is provided "as it is", and
EMEP/MSC-W has very limited resources with which to support usage of the
code.

Computer Information
--------------------

To compile the EMEP/MSC-W model you need:

* Fortran 95 compiler
* NetCDF Library (\> 4.1.3)
* MPI Library (\> 1.0)

It is necessary to compile with double precision real (8 bytes real).
The program has been used on computers ranging from a Linux laptop to
supercomputers (Itanium2 cluster, Intel Xeon cluster, Cray XT4, IBM
power5+). It is compatible with all compilers tested so far: Intel, PGI,
gfortran, XL Fortran. A Makefile is included, the path to NetCDF (``INCL``
and ``LLIB``) have to be adapted to your machine, and the Fortran compiler
(``F90``) and flags (``F90FLAGS``) to the compiler you are using.

The code has been tested with 1 to 1024 CPUs, and scales well (for large
grids). If only one CPU is used 1-2 GB memory is required. If more than
one, for example 64 CPUs are used, 200 MB of memory per CPU is enough
(in the case of a 132 X 159 grid size). For runs on more than 32 CPUs, a
fast interconnect is recommended (infiniband for example), for smaller
runs, gigabit Ethernet is sufficient. It takes \~5 hours on
64\*Xeon X5355 (2.66GHz) for 1 year simulation.

When downloading input data in order to do a "base run" please make sure
that there are 35 Gb disc space available, especially due to large
meteorology input files. The model can be run for shorter periods, users
can download meteorology for only the period they are interested in,
plus one day.

Getting Started
---------------

It is recommended to read all the chapters of this EMEP/MSC-W model User
Guide before you start downloading anything from the EMEP/MSC-W Open
Source website.

This is what you need to do before you can do a "base run" with the
EMEP/MSC-W model:

*  Read the EMEP/MSC-W model User Guide
*  Download input data,
   description and downloading instructions in :numref:`ch-inputfiles`.
*  Download the EMEP/MSC-W model source code,
   description and downloading instructions :numref:`sec-modelcode`.
*  Follow the instructions for "Submitting a Run" description in
   :numref:`ch-submitarun`.
*  Download some model results for comparison,
   description in and downloading instructions :numref:`ch-output`.

The latest release Open Source of the EMEP/MSC-W model is `version rv4_34`__.
This and previous releases can be found on the `releases section`__
of the EMEP/MSC-W Open Source `github page`__.

.. __: https://github.com/metno/emep-ctm/releases/tag/rv4_34
.. __: https://github.com/metno/emep-ctm/releases
.. __: https://github.com/metno/emep-ctm

Although the source code is available for download as a single compressed file on
the release page, the preferred retrieval method is via the `catalog tool`_ as follows:

.. _`catalog tool`: https://github.com/metno/emep-ctm/tree/tools


.. code-block:: bash

    # download the catalog tool
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metno/emep-ctm/tools/catalog.py

    # make it executable and run it
    chmod +x catalog.py

    # download the source code for rv4_34 release
    catalog.py -R rv4_34 --source


The model source code, makefiles, and a copy of the license file
will be placed under the directory ``EMEP_MSC-W_model.rv4.33.OpenSource/source/``.
An overview of the files is given in :numref:`tab-modelfiles`.

.. csv-table:: Model source files
   :name: tab-modelfiles
   :header: **Type**, **Filename**

   modules files        , ``*.f90``
   include files        , ``*.inc``
   namelist             , ``config_emep.nml``
   makefiles            , ``Makefile`` and ``Makefile.SRCS``
   dependency file      , ``dependencies``
   a copy of the license, ``gpl.txt``


In addition there is a run script called ``modrun.sh``, which will be
placed in the ``EMEP_MSC-W_model.rv4.33.OpenSource`` directory. The run script,
``modrun.sh``, can easily be modified to work on your computer system.
This script is described in detail in :numref:`ch-submitarun`.

.. _`sec-modelgrid`:

Model grid
----------

The current EMEP model version, and the provided gridded input data,
have a horizontal resolution of :math:`50\times 50 km^2`
(at :math:`60^\circ N`\ ) and are defined on a polar stereographic projection
with 20 sigma levels vertically. The model is very flexible with regard
to the horizontal resolution, in that it readily makes use of
meteorological data provided with the model. The vertical resolution is
currently still restricted to the fixed 20 layer system. The physical
description is given in detail in Chapter 2 of the EMEP Status Report
1/2003 Part I (Simpson *et al.*, 2003).

In 2008 the EMEP domain was extended eastwards in order to include the
EECCA countries in the EMEP model grid, see :numref:`fig-EECCA`.
To distinguish the new grid from the old EMEP grid, the new grid is called
EECCA in this text and in the ``config_emep.nml``.
