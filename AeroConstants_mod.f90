module AeroConstants_mod

  ! BoxChem/ESX/EMEP need some specific calculations of aerosol
  ! surface area, and we define 7 aerosol types
  ! We end up with variables here to avoid circularity in
  ! Makefile dependencies

  ! To allow emepctm-like aerosol reactions so we can refer to eg AERO%PM_F:
   
  implicit none
